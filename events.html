                        <h4>THE EVENTS</h4>
                        <p> South Africa is the vibrant host of hundreds of events every year – ranging from international sports events and music concerts to local wine tastings and urban markets. Many of these events and festivals are perfect for the whole family, while others are a little more exclusive. This is the ideal destination for such a range of events because the climate is temperate, the cities and towns are unique and full of character, and the infrastructure is equipped to handle the influx of visitors that love supporting the festivities </p>
                        <h4>CAPETOWN CYCLE TOUR</h4>
                        <p>Cape Town's Cycle Tour is the largest timed cycling event in the world. Attracting in excess of 35 000 cyclists from around the globe each year, this prestigious event is definitely a unique experience for participants and spectators alike.

                            Based in Cape Town, the Cycle Tour represents 109 km of some of the most scenic spots in the world. Starting in the City Centre the route makes its way down the Blue Route leading into Simonstown then turning at Smitswinkel and heading back along the coastline before the steady climb up Chapmans Peak and finally the short, steep hill of Suikerbossie. The downhill to the finish in Green Point is a welcome respite for the weary cyclist</p>

               <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
               <p>CAPETOWN IS PARTLY BUILT OVER THE SEA   
                 Known as the ‘Cape Town Foreshore Plan’, land was claimed from the Atlantic Ocean in Table Bay way back in the 1940’s. As the city of Cape Town grew bigger, and seeing as they could not build further up the slopes of the mountain, the idea arose to claim land from the sea. The expansion of new land was around 194 hectares and is where today one can find the railway station, the Cape Town International Convention centre and the civic centre. </p>
               <p>THE CAPE DOCTOR KEEPS THE CITY CLEAN
                 The Cape Doctor keeps the city healthy and clean. Also known as ‘the South Easter’, this very strong and dry wind blows persistently from August up to April. It is locally named the Cape Doctor because it blows everything away; the smog, the pollution and the contamination, making the sky clean and clear again. </p>
               <p>THE JETSET OF CAPETOWN
                 Just over Table Mountain, palm trees, expensive classy restaurants, Humvees, Maseratis and Jaguars are the order of the day. Clifton, Camps Bay, Bakoven, Bantry Bay and Llandudno are also home to some of the most expensive and exclusive real estate in the world. You can be forgiven for thinking you are in Beverly Hills. Llandudno is also the access point to the well known but very secluded unofficial nudist beach of Sandy Bay. It is an 800 metre walk from the nearest parking to the beach. </p>
