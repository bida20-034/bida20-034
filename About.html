                <h4>CULTURE AND HISTORY</h4>
                <p>Cape Town, city and seaport, legislative capital of South Africa and capital of Western Cape province. The city lies at the northern end of the Cape Peninsula some 30 miles (50 kilometres), at its southernmost boundary, north of the Cape of Good Hope. Because it was the site of the first European settlement in South Africa, Cape Town is known as the country’s “mother city.”</p>
                <p>Cape Town, fondly named the Mother City, is the oldest and most culturally aware city in South Africa, bounded by the Indian and Atlantic oceans, it is an exciting mix of first and third world cultures.The gateway to Africa, it is here where indigenous cultures - San, Khoi and Xhosa followed by Europeans and peoples from the Malaysian and Indian Archipelagos first set foot before exploring the rest of South Africa. Indelible cultural fingerprints remains, creating a diverse melting pot and a fascinating travel destination.</p>

                <h4>SASSY SUBURBS</h4>
                <P>Some of the city’s history can also be found in posh suburbs like Bishopscourt, which is snuggled against the hills of the Table Mountain and the famous Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. The suburb started out as Jan van Riebeeck’s farm, known as Boscheuvel or Bush Hill in 1652. Nearly 200 years later in 1849, the farm was bought by the Anglican Church, and renamed it Bishopscourt where it housed Anglican bishops and archbishops of Cape Town. The area is also home to Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, and in 1990 it housed Nelson Mandela for his first night of freedom after his long incarceration.</P>

                <h4>HOME TO THE MAJORITY OF APARTHEID GOVEMENTALS</h4>
                <p>You can’t visit Cape Town and not go to Robben Island in Table Bay, which represents the country’s dark days, and is now a World Heritage site. The apartheid government created Robben Island prison, which kept one of the world’s most famous political prisoners, Nelson Mandela, locked away for 27 years. In 1994, a freed Mandela delivered his first speech as the first president of the democratic South Africa in Parliament.</p>

                 <h3> FUN FACTS</h3>
                 <p>THE WORLD’S FIRST HEART TRANSPLANT TOOK PLACE IN CAPE TOWN.
                    In 1967 the South African doctor Christiaan Barnard performed the world’s first heart transplantation in the world in Cape Town.  Less known is the fact that the patient, unfortunately, died of pneumonia 18 days after the ‘successful’ transplant.</p>
                 <p>THE CAPE PENINSULA WAS ORIGINALLY kNOWN AS THE CAPE OF STORMS
                    As a result of the terrible tempests that have been known to rock the Mother City’s coastline, the Cape Peninsula was originally nicknamed the ‘Cape of Storms’ by legendary explorer Bartholomew Dias. Later, it became known as the Cape of Good Hope because it offered colonial powers the promise of a sea route to the East. </p>
                 <p>THE CAPE FLORAL KINGDOM CLAIMS NEARLY 7000 PLANTS FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
                    The Cape Floral Kingdom, which spans 90 000sq km, is the smallest and richest recognised floral area on the planet and was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO’s committee. Of the 9600 species of plant life that are found in this kingdom, around 70% occur nowhere else in the world. These include the likes of the honey buchu, peninsula snapdragon and Good Hope satinflower.
