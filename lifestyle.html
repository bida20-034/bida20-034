                        <h4>CAPE'S FISHER-FOLKS</h4>
                        <p>The Cape has, what may sometimes seem like, endless miles of coastline. With the Indian Ocean (with the warm Mozambique current) on the east and the Atlantic Ocean (with the colder Benguela current) on the west, fishing is an integral part of life in the Cape. Along the Cape coast you will find villages like Yzerfontein, Hout Bay, Kalk Bay, Struisbaai and Arniston where, in certain respects, time has stood still. The fishermen who live here, learnt the art of fishing from their fathers, who in turn learnt it from their fathers. You will see the fishermen going out to sea in the early hours of the morning. Their boats brightly painted in all shades of the rainbow. Returning in the afternoon with their bounty. Snoek, Yellow Tail, Mackerel and Cob are just a few of the variety of fish caught. In some places like Hout Bay you will find a thriving fish market. Though modern in appearance, it is still based on a centuries old traditionThe life in a fishing village is a simple life. People work hard for the little reward they receive. But ask any fisherman, there is nothing else he would rather do. Fishing is his life. Fishing is what he knows. A fisherman is what he will be until the day he dies. .</p>

                <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
                <p>LION'S HEAD WASN'T ACTUALLY NAMED ITS FELINES   
                    Despite speculation, Lion’s Head does not take its name from being host to some big cats. The story goes that during the 17th century Dutch settlers named the peak Leeuwen Kop (Lion’s Head) and its adjacent summit Leeuwen Staart (Lion’s Tail aka Signal Hill as it’s known today). It was thought that the space between the two peaks is suggestive of a crouching lion.</p>
